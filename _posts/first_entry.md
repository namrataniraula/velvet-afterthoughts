title: Afterthought 1: A Soft Undoing
---

I believe in the quiet power of letting go of anything that holds us from experiencing inner freedom. All the deadlines, sufferings, negative emotions, and energies are creations of our own making. They are not given to us by the universe, nor is it our responsibility to entertain them. The universe does not impose those burdens on us, we do. 
Therefore, be willing to release what does not belong to you and learn to tap into your divine energy by surrendering to the universe. Do exactly what feels true to you, aligns with your purpose, and fulfills what is expected of you in this lifetime. The universe is your guide, your true friend, your true lover, and the only real possession you have in this lifetime.
Money, family, friends, relationships, and romantic partners are merely things we identify with, but they do not belong to us. Your name, your body, the country you were born in, the parents you were born to, and everything external were given to you. You had no control over any of it. So, what can truly be yours if you never had control over it in the first place?
Anything that is not your internal self, like your external identities, will always be under attack, meaning they will continue to change. Think about when you lose a job. The part of you that identified with that position is now in crisis. That identity is fading. You are no longer an employee. This creates emotional turmoil and takes control over you, stripping you of inner freedom.
The bitter truth about external identities is that we have no control over them. Therefore, we should recognize them for what they are and avoid becoming too attached. They should never define us. Otherwise, our sense of self will constantly be under attack.
Our thought process, intellect, behaviors, and core values are our true identity. These are what truly define us. The way we choose to act, the way we formulate our responses, and the way we stand up against anything that contradicts our morals, these aspects of us are always within our control. Nobody can dictate them for us. At any moment, we have the power to reclaim them.
Once we adopt this perspective and live accordingly, we will experience freedom in its truest sense. For this reason, I believe in the power of letting go of anything that exploits our inner freedom.
