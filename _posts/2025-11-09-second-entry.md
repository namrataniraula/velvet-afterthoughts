Everybody talks about young love, marrying young, teenage love, but nobody talks about old-age love. A love that has ripened with time. A quiet flame that never went out. A love that is prevelant solely because you respect your significant's presence and admire their soul. No games, no manipultion, no competition, no lustful desires, simply consiousness of other person's energy and value they add to your life. You both had your own experiences at life, shared or unshared. Money, family, house, car vacations are now wispers of the past. Now, all that matters is a quality of time for the remainder of your life on earth. It's almost as a promise to take care of each other without any expectations. You both walk into this with wisdom that exceeds years of experience and a heart that yearns for love so pure, so serene, transcending all its wordly definitions. People romanticize young love to an extend that it has created an unspoken pressure of find 'the one' early in life. Oh what a freeing thought to realize you have all your life to find 'the one'. Oh what a freeing thought to realize you'd rather wait for years to find 'the right' one than investing all your time and energy into someone you cannot experience old-age love with.

I yearn for love so exquisite, so divine that trancends all of humanly expectations. A love that lingers even in their absence. A love that grows everyday. A soft, gentle love free from sexual desires and lustful thoughts. A love that feels like a promise, an unspoken wisper almost to be there for each other through health and sickness, through yound and old-age, through richess and poverty. A love that has seen it all, yet consiously decides to stay.
