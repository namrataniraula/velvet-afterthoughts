Today I slept well knowing my purpose is to simply be. What else is greater in life than to experience. The only purpose that is common to the entire humankind is to exist and experience. All the self imposed responsibilities aside, all that is truely ever expected of you is to exist and experience. The ego, however, wants you to have a sense of external purpose to fill the existential void, to feel important, and to give meaning to life, which are equally important inorder to not loose your sense of direction. This very ego keeps you sane. Once you understand yourself beyond your ego, you'll find eternal peace. Oh what a freeing thought to know that your only purpose in life is to simply be.
