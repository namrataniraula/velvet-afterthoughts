Today I slept well knowing my purpose in life is to simply be. What else is greater in life than to experience. The only purpose that is common to the entire humankind is to exist and experience. All the self imposed responsibilities aside, all that is truely ever expected of you is to exist and experience. The ego, however, wants you to have a sense of external purpose to fill the existential void, to feel important, and to give meaning to life, which are equally important inorder to not loose your sense of direction. This very ego keeps you sane. Once you understand yourself beyond your ego, you'll find eternal peace. Oh what a freeing thought to know that your only purpose in life is to simply be. 

Learning to seperate yourself from your feelings and emotions and seeing them as a part of life is a skill, and mastery of that skill leads you to eternal peace. We should always want to want what is happening to us. That way we are always accepting of our situation and saving ourselves of mysery trying to contemplate a life 'that could be'. The life of our imagination. To deny a situation is to deny the universe. The universe exists and so does your situation. The very step to mastery of the skill is to not label any of your experience as 'good' or 'bad'. Every experince in life should be to take you one step closer to a life fully lived. You can never save yourself from your externals not working according to your wants and needs. They are externals, and not under your control. Running away from situation that doesnot necessitate your desires only opens doors to mysery. 

To have lived a life completely and fully to every extent, you'd rather want to feel every single emotion to your bones, to visit as many places as you can, to eat every single food known to you, to try every single hobby, to read as many books, to go through as many heartbreaks, to meet as many new people, to feel guit, shame, and remorse as deeply, to spend as much time with family and friends, and to experience as many failures.
