Expectation kills quality. The moment you set your expectations on things or experiences, you're determining a standard to which you'd accept the thing to do or the experience to turn out. Not only are you imposing them to work a certain way, you're  also ultering the natural flow of unfolding of the event or the experience. You walk into it with a heart full of attachment and a mind full of prejudices. Expectations are the direct links to the external world. And from what we know of externals, they are not under our control, and are subjects to change or destruction. This tells us that there's no guarantee that things turn out in accord to your expectations, no matter how hard you try. Having expectations is like opening doors to disappointment. One is destined to be disappointed and go through emotional turmoil, once they let their externals determine the quality of the experience they're anticipating. Especially, if one walks into an experience with higher expectations, they're perspective is already blurred with the vision of that higher expectation coming true. If that isn't the case, their whole mind is preoccupied by this one thing not working out, forgetting to account for every other 'smaller' thing that did go well.

The same thing goes for people. The moment you expect people to act a certain way, dress up a certain way, expect them to show up to all of your self imposed responsibilities in direct link to your relationship with them or the role they play in your life, you're always holding them against a certain set of constraints.  This limits or obstructs the natural flow or development of the human connection with them. The human connection becomes diluted, full of judgment and prejudice. This is especially important to keep in mind when thinking of relationships that mean a lot to you. Would you rather weigh down your loved ones with constraints, expectations, and responsibilities to a point they cannot physically fulfill them, altering your relationship with them or give them all the freedom of their choices and acts, encouraging a natural flow of the relationship to build beautifully, authentically, and purely with time?

We can never make anyone act in accordance with what we want. That's where we question their free will. Everybody has their own free will to prioritize one thing or person over the other. Also to decide if they want to continue playing a certain role (of a sister, friend, mother, or a daughter) in someone else's life. Anytime they decide to change, they have all the rights to do so. Nobody is ever entitled to abide by your or societal expectations or rules. Implying that would  mean you are asking them for their basic right; their right to freedom. You can always simply ask them to give you what you want or verbelize your expectations of that situation, with the possibility of being denied to or your expectations 
not being met. Understanding this simple fact will help you preserve your peace of mind and your relationships with your loved ones.

We often walk into romantic relationships thinking our partners will presumably fulfill all the 'duties' of a good, loving partner. Be it solving our problems, fulfilling our emotional needs, or magically subsiding our humanly existential void. No human being can ever be a part of your inner world, let alone influence any changes of your way of life, thoughts, values, and beliefs. Implying those big responsibilities on them and expecting that they fulfill all of it in order to be deserving of one's love, affection, respect is just setting them up for failure. And we can all agree what a conditional way of relationship that would be.
